It’s less akin to computer engineering and more like to building a Lego set, if the Legos were much fewer in number and much pricier.\n\nLike any problem, it helps to break it down in parts, in this case, computer parts.\n\nWhat do you need to build a gaming PC and what to consider in terms of gaming PC part compatibility? Here’s a comprehensive gaming PC part list, with a caveat we give from experience: be wary of part compatibility and do your research before you buy any individual part!\n\n- Case\n- Motherboard\n- Central processing unit (CPU)\n- Graphics processing unit (GPU/graphics card/video card)\n- RAM\n- Power supply unit (PSU)\n- Hard drive (SSD/HDD)\n- Cooling\n\nGaming peripherals/accessories:\n- Gaming monitors\n- Gaming mice\n- Gaming keyboards\n- Gaming speakers\n- Gaming headsets",

That’s what this guide is about: how to build a PC from parts.\n\nThis can be daunting for a lot of reasons—it’s expensive, it’s complex, it can get messy. But I want to be clear: If you can build an Ikea table, bookshelf, bed, or anything that comes in more than one of those deceivingly heavy flat packs, you can build a PC. The tricky part? I can't tell you how to build your PC. Not really. Not unless I know exactly which hardware you're using. I can, however, explain what each component does and what my recommendations are for each category.",
